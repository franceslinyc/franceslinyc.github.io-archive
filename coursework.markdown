<p align="justify"> This page contains a list of coursework and serves to summarize major topics we have learned throughout my time here at OSU. If / when time permits, I wish to turn them into posts. </p>

#### Overview 

<p align="justify"> First year of Master's at OSU, major parts of our coursework focused on building the fundamentals: statistical methods and theories. Second year of Master's, we expanded beyond statistical methods and theories to include additional statistical models (e.g. GLMs) and simulation / optimization methods (e.g. EM). I also gained experience working with big (> 100 GB) data using cloud computing platforms (e.g. GCP, PySpark / Apache Spark). </p>  

<p align="justify"> First year of PhD's also at OSU, we dived into advanced topics in statistics (e.g. decision theory, theories for GLMs/GLMMs). I also took a sneak peek of advanced techniques (e.g. reduced-rank regression, spatial GLMMs, INLA, MCMC), while completing course & independent projects. </p>

<p align="justify"> Second year of PhD's, I spend most time in Bayesian spatial models such as Gaussian processes (GPs), variant GPs, NNGPs and NNMPs, and Markovian time series models such as MTDs. </p>
